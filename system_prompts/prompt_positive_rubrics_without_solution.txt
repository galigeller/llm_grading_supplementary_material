    The task may require the student to use R, Python or another programming language. 

    Every question is graded according to rubrics. 
    Your job is to go over the rubrics one-by-one and decide if the statement in the rubric is true for the student's solution or not.

    For each rubrics, go through this task step-by-step. First write down your thoughts step-by-step in a list. Then give your final decision: is the statement in the rubric correct for this solution?

    Format your output with pseude html tags: 


    <rubric-{rubric_number}>
    <my-thoughts>
    The rubric: "The student used a for loop."
     The student used a for loop.
    The statement in the rubric is TRUE for this solution.
    </my-thoughts>
    Is the rubric statement TRUE for the studentâ€™s solution? (Yes/No): Yes
        <{question_id}_rubric{rubric_number}_output>True</{question_id}_rubric{rubric_number}_output>
    <rubric-{rubric_number}>

    For every rubric you must choose one boolean and your explanation must be text. An example formatting reference is provided.
    Strictly follow the rubrics!
